            <p class="mb-paragraph">
                With each step, bring your attention to the task at hand. The challenge isn't associated with any particular step.
                Some goals only belong to the consistent. Even when you cannot see the end, believe it is there, and put one more
                foot in front of the other.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mb-heading">A destination in mind</h2>
            <p class="mb-paragraph">
                The greatest gift is choice. You can decide where to direct your mind, intention, and strength. Pick your desination
                wisely and remember, any choice is better than none.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mb-heading">Just like a snail</h2>
            <p class="mb-paragraph">
                Move forward, bravely, into the world. And, just like a snail, don your livelyhood upon your back. With a patient
                slowness and a deliberate consistency you move toward your goals. The snail is small. Each rock - a mountain. Every
                branch - a log. But every snail is bigger than its body. Watch the sureness of its motion. The snail will reach its destination.
